- **Operators**: Arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators
- **Control Flow**: Conditional statements (if, elif, else)
- **Loops**: For and while loops, iteration techniques
- **Functions**: Defining, calling, and working with parameters
- **Error Handling**: Basic exception management

### 2. Python Collections (`Python_Collections.ipynb`)
This notebook explores:
- **Lists**: Ordered, changeable collections with duplicates
  - Creating and accessing lists
  - List indices and slicing
  - Common list methods (append, remove, pop, etc.)
  - List comprehensions
- **Tuples**: Ordered, immutable collections
  - Tuple operations and unpacking
  - Use cases for immutability
- **Sets**: Unordered collections without duplicates
  - Set operations (union, intersection, difference)
  - Mathematical set operations
- **Dictionaries**: Key-value pair collections
  - Accessing and modifying dictionary data
  - Dictionary methods
  - Practical applications

## 📖 How to Use These Notebooks

### For Students:
1. **Sequential Learning**: Start with "Introduction to Python" before moving to "Python Collections"
2. **Execute Cells**: Run each code cell (Shift + Enter) to see the output
3. **Complete TO DO sections**: Look for "TO DO" instructions and complete the exercises
4. **Experiment**: Modify the code and observe how changes affect the output
5. **Practice**: Try to solve problems before looking at solutions

### Interactive Features:
- **Markdown Cells**: Contain explanations and instructions (blue highlight when selected)
- **Code Cells**: Contain executable Python code (green highlight when selected)
- **Run cells**: Press `Shift + Enter` or click the "Run" button
- **Insert cells**: Use the `+` button or `Insert` menu
- **Cell types**: Change between Code and Markdown using the dropdown menu

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Practice Regularly**: Programming is a skill that improves with practice
2. **Read Error Messages**: They provide valuable information about what went wrong
3. **Comment Your Code**: Use `#` to add explanations
4. **Ask Questions**: Don't hesitate to seek clarification from instructors
5. **Collaborate**: Discuss concepts with classmates
6. **Explore Beyond**: Try additional examples and challenges

## 📝 Workshop Structure

Each notebook follows a structured approach:
- **Concept Introduction**: Clear explanation of topics
- **Code Examples**: Practical demonstrations
- **Hands-on Exercises**: "TO DO" sections for practice
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Building from basic to advanced concepts

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Jupyter won't start:**
- Ensure Python and Jupyter are correctly installed
- Try: `pip install --upgrade jupyter`

**Kernel issues:**
- Restart the kernel: `Kernel → Restart`
- Clear output and restart: `Kernel → Restart & Clear Output`

**Import errors:**
- Install missing packages: `pip install package_name`

**Code doesn't run:**
- Check for syntax errors (look for red highlights)
- Ensure previous cells are executed in order
